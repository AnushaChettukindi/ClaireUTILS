# ClaireUTILS

An **extremely** minimal set of core utilities for Linux/UNIX like systems.

### Requirements

1. GCC (any recent version should work; preferably v9.3.0)
2. GNU Make (same as above; preferably v4.2.1)

### Build

Run `make` to build all programs. To build a specific program,
run `make <program>` . For example, to build 'ls', one would run `make ls`.
Run `make help` to see the list of all available targets.
