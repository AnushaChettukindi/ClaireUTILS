# ClaireUTILS

An **extremely** minimal set of core utilities for UNIX-like systems.
(runs on Linux and FreeBSD at the moment)

### Requirements

1. GCC or Clang (any recent version should work)
2. GNU make or Berkeley make (same as above)

### Build

Run `make` to build all programs. To build a specific program,
run `make <program>` . For example, to build 'ls', one would run `make ls`.
Run `make help` to see the list of all available targets.

### Note
ClaireUTILS is still in its early stages of development. It is prone to
unnoticed bugs and such.

### License
ClaireUTILS is licenced under the GNU GPLv3. See "LICENSE" for more
